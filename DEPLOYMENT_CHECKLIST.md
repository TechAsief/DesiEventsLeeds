# ðŸš€ Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure a smooth deployment to production.

## Pre-Deployment Tasks

# Commit
git commit -m "Production ready - initial deployment"

# Create repository on GitHub, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DesiEventsLeeds.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Vercel Deployment (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create Neon Database
- [ ] Go to https://neon.tech
- [ ] Create new project (or use existing)
- [ ] Copy connection string
- [ ] Save as `DATABASE_URL`

### Step 2: Setup Gmail App Password
- [ ] Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
- [ ] Enable 2-Factor Authentication
- [ ] Go to "App passwords"
- [ ] Create new app password
- [ ] Save as `EMAIL_PASS`

### Step 3: Generate Session Secret
```bash
# Run this command and copy the output
openssl rand -hex 32
```
- [ ] Save as `SESSION_SECRET`

### Step 4: Deploy to Vercel
- [ ] Go to https://vercel.com
- [ ] Sign in with GitHub
- [ ] Click "Add New Project"
- [ ] Import your repository
- [ ] Configure build settings:
  - Framework: Vite
  - Build Command: `npm run build`
  - Output Directory: `dist`

### Step 5: Add Environment Variables in Vercel

Add these in Vercel Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host/db
ADMIN_EMAIL=asief1991@gmail.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=DesiEvents@123
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-16-char-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@desieventsleeds.com
SESSION_SECRET=your-random-32-char-hex-string
NODE_ENV=production
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
```

- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` added
- [ ] `ADMIN_EMAIL` added
- [ ] `ADMIN_PASSWORD` added
- [ ] `EMAIL_USER` added
- [ ] `EMAIL_PASS` added
- [ ] `EMAIL_FROM` added
- [ ] `SESSION_SECRET` added
- [ ] `NODE_ENV` set to `production`
- [ ] `FRONTEND_URL` added (use your Vercel URL)

### Step 6: Deploy
- [ ] Click "Deploy"
- [ ] Wait for build to complete
- [ ] Visit your production URL

### Step 7: Setup CI/CD (Optional)

To enable automatic deployments on every push:

1. Get Vercel tokens:
